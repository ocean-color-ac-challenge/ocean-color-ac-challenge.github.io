# Community Involvement

Round robin activities are a common part of the Ocean Colour community with recent examples having been carried out as a result of the ESA OC_CCI and Coastcolour projects.

However, it’s only the OC_CCI project that carried out a round robin for atmospheric correction (focused on Case 1 waters, dominated by phytoplankton), and this (as with Coastcolour) focused on users being supplied by the test data and then running it on their own code with their own resources.

There was also a theoretical / simulated data comparison carried out within the context of the International Ocean Colour Co-ordinating Group (IOCCG) e.g. see the summary of Intercomparison of Retrieval Algorithms for Coastal Waters.

Therefore, running a contest on a Cloud platform will be a new experience and users will need support in having their in-house breadboards ported to this environment. 

To encourage community involvement the contest will be advertised through existing ESA projects / activities, such as the OC_CCI and MERIS QWG, and through the mailing lists of organisations such as IOCCG as well as through ESA’s own routes.
