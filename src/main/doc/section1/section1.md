# About the Data Challenge

This challenge is based around ocean colour Atmospheric Correction (AC) and the use of auxiliary information thatâ€™s needed when processing the data from Level 1 (Top of Atmosphere, TOA, calibrated radiances / reflectances) to Level 2 products (Bottom of Atmosphere, BOA, calibrated radiances/reflectance and derived products), i.e. this challenge has an application focus. This encompasses the aim of investigating new / novel approaches (could be within the software and/or algorithm) alongside existing code in order to look towards future developments.
