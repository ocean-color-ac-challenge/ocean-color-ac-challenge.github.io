# Earth Observation data

The participants will need to register as MERIS data users ([ESA Fast web-based Registration form](http://bit.ly/1pauv6m)), which in turn requires an [EO-SSO account](https://earth.esa.int/web/guest/general-registration)) and then there will be an additional agreement; see ‘Code of Conduct’ section below. 

The MERIS Level 1 data will be read-only and so not available to download; discouraging off-line tuning. The Earth Observation (EO) outputs, which is the MERIS Level 2 data, will be available to download; only that belonging to each participant’s own processing results.
