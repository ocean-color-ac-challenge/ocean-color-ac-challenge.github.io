# In-situ data

Itâ€™s not envisaged that the in-situ data will be made available to the participants. 

The initiator will need to sign the MERMAID Data Access and Account Registration Protocol on behalf of the contest, which clearly states that MERMAID data cannot be distributed. In addition, it states the credit / acknowledgement that is required for any resulting publication; involves contacting the originators of the in-situ data on an individual basis.
