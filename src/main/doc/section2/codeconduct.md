# Code of Conduct

The contest will be conducted as a blind experiment where participants will upload their code / executable(s) for processing to occur within the E-CEO cloud platform.  

The participants will be asked to agree to the following statement (shown as a pop-up when they login to the E-CEO platform for the first time):

> If results arising from the Contest are published within reports or scientific publications produced by the participant then the participant (yourself and your colleagues) will duly acknowledge that the processing was conducted using the ESA E-CEO Platform. It’s envisaged that overall results from the contest (for all participants) will be published as a technical report and/or peer-reviewed publication where authorship will be offered to all participants; authorship will be alphabetical after the lead author who’s likely to be the initiator. Results will be anonymised unless permission to publish the participant’s name(s)/code/institution has been obtained in advance.”

Accepting this statement will allow the participants to download the results of the processing i.e. Level 2 EO output products.
